WHAT: Nightly orchestration entrypoint to run the full ETL: bronze → silver → gold → load.
WHEN: Triggered by CI/CD (cron) or run manually by ops.

INPUTS → OUTPUTS:
- INPUTS: `.env` configuration, `data/sources/` inputs, and remote EUDK content.
- OUTPUTS: Artifacts in `data/bronze`, `data/silver`, `data/gold`, and loaded rows in Postgres.

Key functions to implement next:
- run_bronze_csv_ingest()
- run_bronze_md_eudk()
- run_silver_normalize()
- run_gold_dedupe()
- run_gold_embed()
- run_load_pg()
- notify_slack()
- main()
